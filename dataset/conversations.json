Feeling like a burden can be incredibly painful and isolating, and I want you to know that those feelings are valid.

Many people go through periods where they feel this way, and often, it's our own minds being unkind to us.\n\nRight now, I'm here to listen without judgment. If you feel up to it, would you like to talk a little more about what's making you feel this way? Sometimes just sharing can bring a little relief.\n\nAnd if it feels overwhelming to talk, perhaps we could think about a small, kind thing you could do for yourself today, even something as simple as taking a few deep breaths."
